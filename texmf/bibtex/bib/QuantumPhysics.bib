  abstract = {The new quantum mechanics, when applied to the problem of the structure of the atom with point-charge electrons, does not give results in agreement with experiment. The discrepancies consist of ``duplexity '' phenomena, the observed number of stationary states for an electron in an atom being twice the number given by the theory. To meet the difficulty, Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck have introduced the idea of an electron with a spin angular momentum of half a quantum and a magnetic moment of one Bohr magneton. This model for the electron has been fitted into the new mechanics by Pauli,* and Darwin,\textdagger{} working with an equivalent theory, has shown that it gives results in agreement with experiment for hydrogen-like spectra to the first order of accuracy. The question remains as to why Nature should have chosen this particular model for the electron instead of being satisfied with the point-charge. One would like to find some incompleteness in the previous methods of applying quantum mechanics to the point-charge electron such that, when removed, the whole of the duplexity phenomena follow without arbitrary assumptions. In the present paper it is shown that this is the case, the incompleteness of the previous theories lying in their disagreement with relativity, or, alternatetively, with the general transformation theory of quantum mechanics. It appears that the simplest Hamiltonian for a point-charge electron satisfying the requirements of both relativity and the general transformation theory leads to an explanation of all duplexity phenomena without further assumption. All the same there is a great deal of truth in the spinning electron model, at least as a first approximation. The most important failure of the model seems to be that the magnitude of the resultant orbital angular momentum of an electron moving in an orbit in a central field of force is not a constant, as the model leads one to expect.},

  abstract = {We discuss some generic properties of lepton number violating (L/ ) processes and their relation to different entries of the Majorana neutrino mass matrix. Present and near future experiments searching for these processes, except the neutrinoless double beta decay, are unable to probe light(eV mass region) and heavy(hundred GeV mass region) neutrinos. On the other hand due to the effect of a resonant enhancement, some of L/ decays can be very sensitive to the intermediate mass neutrinos with typical masses in hundred MeV region. These neutrinos may appear as admixtures of the three active and an arbitrary number of sterile neutrino species. We analyze the experimental constraints on these massive neutrino states and discuss their possible cosmological and astrophysical implications.},

  abstract = {The physics responsible for neutrino masses and lepton mixing remains unknown. More experimental data are needed to constrain and guide possible generalizations of the standard model of particle physics, and reveal the mechanism behind nonzero neutrino masses. Here, the physics associated with searches for the violation of lepton-flavor conservation in charged-lepton processes and the violation of lepton-number conservation in nuclear physics processes is summarized. In the first part, several aspects of charged-lepton flavor violation are discussed, especially its sensitivity to new particles and interactions beyond the standard model of particle physics. The discussion concentrates mostly on rare processes involving muons and electrons. In the second part, the status of the conservation of total lepton number is discussed. The discussion here concentrates on current and future probes of this apparent law of Nature via searches for neutrinoless double beta decay, which is also the most sensitive probe of the potential Majorana nature of neutrinos.},

We illustrate this by constructing a simple model that allows for lepton number violation by four units only. As a consequence, neutrinoless double beta decay is forbidden, but neutrinoless quadruple beta decay is possible: \$(A,Z) \textbackslash{}to (A,Z+4) + 4 e\^-\$. We identify three candidate isotopes for this decay, the most promising one being Nd-150 due to its high \$Q\_\{0\textbackslash{}nu 4\textbackslash{}beta\}\$-value of 2 MeV. Analogous processes, such as neutrinoless quadruple electron capture, are also possible. The expected lifetimes are extremely long, and experimental searches are challenging.},

  abstract = {We discuss the experimental prospects for observing processes which violate lepton number (∆L) in four units (or more). First, we reconsider neutrinoless quadruple beta decay, deriving a model independent and very conservative lower limit on its half-life of the order of 1041 ys for 150Nd. This renders quadruple beta decay unobservable for any feasible experiment. We then turn to a more general discussion of diﬀerent possible low-energy processes with values of ∆L ≥ 4. A simple operator analysis leads to rather pessimistic conclusions about the observability at low-energy experiments in all cases we study. However, the situation looks much brighter for accelerator experiments. For two example models with ∆L = 4 and another one with ∆L = 5, we show how the LHC or a hypothetical future pp-collider, such as the FCC, could probe multi-lepton number violating operators at the TeV scale.},
