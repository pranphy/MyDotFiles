  abstract = {Neutrinoless  double  beta  decay  (0$\nu\beta\beta$)  is  a  rare,  second-order  process  that  occurs  in  certain isotopes for which beta decay is energetically forbidden.  EXO-200 is a 0$\nu\beta\beta$ experiment with 110
kg  of  active  liquid  xenon  (LXe)   isotopically  enriched  in 136 Xe.   EXO-200  detects  events  using  a
combination of scintillation and ionization signals, which allows for excellent particle discrimination.
However, events with a low ionization signal cannot be fully characterized with the current analysis
framework.  To fill in these gaps,  we introduce a boosted decision tree regressor as a new tool to
characterize events in the detector.  We focus on $\alpha$ decays of  222Rn and its progeny, which have low ionization signals that often fall below the  threshold for position reconstruction.  Using information gained  from  this  technique,  we  confirm  previous  results  for  the 218Po  ion  velocity  and  improve
previous results for the 218Po ionization fraction.  We also investigate events that occur near the walls of the vessel.  These events have no ionization signal and therefore cannot be characterized
with any existing technique in the analysis framework.  By investigating these events we determine that they are not distributed uniformly throughout the detector, which may point to charging up of  the  plastics  inside  the  LXe  vessel  or  a  ``hot  spot''  on  the  plastic  due  to  contamination  during cleaning and installation.},

  abstract = {The most abundant particles in the Universe are photons and neutrinos. Both types of particles are whirling around everywhere, since the early Universe. Hence the neutrinos are all around us, and permanently pass through our planet and our bodies, but we do not notice: they are extremely elusive. They were suggested as a theoretical hypothesis in 1930, and discovered experimentally in 1956. Ever since their properties keep on surprising us; for instance, they are key players in the violation of parity symmetry. In the Standard Model of particle physics they appear in three types, known as "flavors", and since 1998/9 we know that they keep on transmuting among these flavors. This "neutrino oscillation" implies that they are massive, contrary to the previous picture, with far-reaching consequences. This discovery was awarded the Physics Nobel Prize 2015.},

  abstract = {Neutrinoless double beta decay, which is a very old and yet elusive process, is reviewed. Its observation will signal that lepton number is not conserved and the neutrinos are Majorana particles. More importantly it is our best hope for determining the absolute neutrino mass scale at the level of a few tens of meV. To achieve the last goal certain hurdles have to be overcome involving particle, nuclear and experimental physics. Nuclear physics is important for extracting the useful information from the data. One must accurately evaluate the relevant nuclear matrix elements, a formidable task. To this end, we review the sophisticated nuclear structure approaches recently been developed, which give confidence that the needed nuclear matrix elements can be reliably calculated. From an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the life times are long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. If a signal is found, it will be a tremendous accomplishment. Then, of course, the real task is going to be the extraction of the neutrino mass from the observations. This is not trivial, since current particle models predict the presence of many mechanisms other than the neutrino mass, which may contribute or even dominate this process. We will, in particular, consider the following processes: (i)The neutrino induced, but neutrino mass independent contribution. (ii)Heavy left and/or right handed neutrino mass contributions. (iii)Intermediate scalars (doubly charged etc). (iv)Supersymmetric (SUSY) contributions. We will show that it is possible to disentangle the various mechanisms and unambiguously extract the important neutrino mass scale, if all the signatures of the reaction are searched in a sufficient number of nuclear isotopes.},

With this in mind, cosmogenic backgrounds have been studied with the EXO-200 experiment. Using the EXO-200 TPC, the muon ﬂux (through a ﬂat horizontal surface) underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) has been measured to be Φ = 4.07 ± 0.14 (sys) ± 0.03 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1, with a vertical intensity of Iv = 2.97+−00..1143 (sys) ± 0.02 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1 sr−1. Simulations of muon-induced backgrounds identiﬁed several potential cosmogenic radionuclides, though only 137Xe is a signiﬁcant background for the 136Xe 0νββ search with EXO-200. Muon-induced neutron backgrounds were measured using γ-rays from neutron capture on the detector materials. This provided a measurement of 137Xe yield, and a test of the accuracy of the neutron production and transport simulations. The independently measured rates of 136Xe neutron capture and of 137Xe decay agree within uncertainties. Geant4 and FLUKA simulations were performed to estimate neutron capture rates, and these estimates agreed to within ∼40% or better with measurements. The ability to identify 136Xe(n, γ) events will allow for rejection of 137Xe backgrounds in future 0νββ analyses.},

The problems range from the mechanism of the decay, i.e. exchange of the light Majorana neutrino versus the exchange of some heavy, so far unobserved particle. Next, the proper expressions for the corresponding operator are described that should include the effects of the nucleon size and of the recoil order terms in the hadronic current. The issue of proper treatment of the short range correlations, in particular for the case of the heavy particle exchange, is discussed also. The variety of methods employed these days in the theoretical evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements M0$\nu$ is briefly described and the difficulties causing the spread and hence uncertainty in the values of M0$\nu$ are discussed. Finally, the issue of the axial current quenching, and of the resonance enhancement in the case of double electron capture are described.},

We also develop a novel approach to calculation of the oscillation probability in the wave-packet approach, based on the summation/integration conventions different from the standard one, which allows a new insight into the ``same energy'' vs. ``same momentum'' problem.

  abstract = {We describe an approach to the study of neutrino masses that combines quantum optics techniques with radiation detectors to obtain unprecedented sensitivity. With it the search for Majorana neutrino masses down to $\sim$10 meV will become accessible. The experimental technique uses the possibility of individually detecting Ba+-ions in the final state of 136Xe double-beta decay via resonant excitation with a set of lasers aimed at a specific location in a large Time Projection Chamber. The specificity of the atomic levels provides tagging and, together with more traditional event recognition parameters, greatly suppresses radioactive backgrounds.},
