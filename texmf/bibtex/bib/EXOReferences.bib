  abstract = {Neutrinoless  double  beta  decay  (0{$\nu\beta\beta$})  is  a  rare,  second-order  process  that  occurs  in  certain isotopes for which beta decay is energetically forbidden.  EXO-200 is a 0{$\nu\beta\beta$} experiment with 110
kg  of  active  liquid  xenon  (LXe)   isotopically  enriched  in 136 Xe.   EXO-200  detects  events  using  a
combination of scintillation and ionization signals, which allows for excellent particle discrimination.
However, events with a low ionization signal cannot be fully characterized with the current analysis
framework.  To fill in these gaps,  we introduce a boosted decision tree regressor as a new tool to
characterize events in the detector.  We focus on {$\alpha$} decays of  222Rn and its progeny, which have low ionization signals that often fall below the  threshold for position reconstruction.  Using information gained  from  this  technique,  we  confirm  previous  results  for  the 218Po  ion  velocity  and  improve
previous results for the 218Po ionization fraction.  We also investigate events that occur near the walls of the vessel.  These events have no ionization signal and therefore cannot be characterized
with any existing technique in the analysis framework.  By investigating these events we determine that they are not distributed uniformly throughout the detector, which may point to charging up of  the  plastics  inside  the  LXe  vessel  or  a  ``hot  spot''  on  the  plastic  due  to  contamination  during cleaning and installation.},

  abstract = {The most abundant particles in the Universe are photons and neutrinos. Both types of particles are whirling around everywhere, since the early Universe. Hence the neutrinos are all around us, and permanently pass through our planet and our bodies, but we do not notice: they are extremely elusive. They were suggested as a theoretical hypothesis in 1930, and discovered experimentally in 1956. Ever since their properties keep on surprising us; for instance, they are key players in the violation of parity symmetry. In the Standard Model of particle physics they appear in three types, known as "flavors", and since 1998/9 we know that they keep on transmuting among these flavors. This "neutrino oscillation" implies that they are massive, contrary to the previous picture, with far-reaching consequences. This discovery was awarded the Physics Nobel Prize 2015.},

  abstract = {Neutrinoless double beta decay, which is a very old and yet elusive process, is reviewed. Its observation will signal that lepton number is not conserved and the neutrinos are Majorana particles. More importantly it is our best hope for determining the absolute neutrino mass scale at the level of a few tens of meV. To achieve the last goal certain hurdles have to be overcome involving particle, nuclear and experimental physics. Nuclear physics is important for extracting the useful information from the data. One must accurately evaluate the relevant nuclear matrix elements, a formidable task. To this end, we review the sophisticated nuclear structure approaches recently been developed, which give confidence that the needed nuclear matrix elements can be reliably calculated. From an experimental point of view it is challenging, since the life times are long and one has to fight against formidable backgrounds. If a signal is found, it will be a tremendous accomplishment. Then, of course, the real task is going to be the extraction of the neutrino mass from the observations. This is not trivial, since current particle models predict the presence of many mechanisms other than the neutrino mass, which may contribute or even dominate this process. We will, in particular, consider the following processes: (i)The neutrino induced, but neutrino mass independent contribution. (ii)Heavy left and/or right handed neutrino mass contributions. (iii)Intermediate scalars (doubly charged etc). (iv)Supersymmetric (SUSY) contributions. We will show that it is possible to disentangle the various mechanisms and unambiguously extract the important neutrino mass scale, if all the signatures of the reaction are searched in a sufficient number of nuclear isotopes.},

  abstract = {As neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments become more sensitive and intrinsic radioactivity in detector materials is reduced, previously minor contributions to the background must be understood and eliminated. With this in mind, cosmogenic backgrounds have been studied with the EXO-200 experiment. Using the EXO-200 TPC, the muon ﬂux (through a ﬂat horizontal surface) underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) has been measured to be Φ = 4.07 ± 0.14 (sys) ± 0.03 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1, with a vertical intensity of Iv = 2.97+−00..1143 (sys) ± 0.02 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1 sr−1. Simulations of muon-induced backgrounds identiﬁed several potential cosmogenic radionuclides, though only 137Xe is a signiﬁcant background for the 136Xe 0νββ search with EXO-200. Muon-induced neutron backgrounds were measured using γ-rays from neutron capture on the detector materials. This provided a measurement of 137Xe yield, and a test of the accuracy of the neutron production and transport simulations. The independently measured rates of 136Xe neutron capture and of 137Xe decay agree within uncertainties. Geant4 and FLUKA simulations were performed to estimate neutron capture rates, and these estimates agreed to within ∼40% or better with measurements. The ability to identify 136Xe(n, γ) events will allow for rejection of 137Xe backgrounds in future 0νββ analyses.},

The problems range from the mechanism of the decay, i.e. exchange of the light Majorana neutrino versus the exchange of some heavy, so far unobserved particle. Next, the proper expressions for the corresponding operator are described that should include the effects of the nucleon size and of the recoil order terms in the hadronic current. The issue of proper treatment of the short range correlations, in particular for the case of the heavy particle exchange, is discussed also. The variety of methods employed these days in the theoretical evaluation of the nuclear matrix elements M0{$\nu$} is briefly described and the difficulties causing the spread and hence uncertainty in the values of M0{$\nu$} are discussed. Finally, the issue of the axial current quenching, and of the resonance enhancement in the case of double electron capture are described.},

We also develop a novel approach to calculation of the oscillation probability in the wave-packet approach, based on the summation/integration conventions different from the standard one, which allows a new insight into the ``same energy'' vs. ``same momentum'' problem.

With it the search for Majorana neutrino masses down to {$\sim$}10 meV will become accessible. The experimental technique uses the possibility of individually detecting Ba+-ions in the final state of 136Xe double-beta decay via resonant excitation with a set of lasers aimed at a specific location in a large Time Projection Chamber. The specificity of the atomic levels provides tagging and, together with more traditional event recognition parameters, greatly suppresses radioactive backgrounds.},

If the process is actually observed, we will immediately learn much about the neutrino. The status and discovery potential of proposed experiments are reviewed in this context, with significant emphasis on proposals favored by recent panel reviews.

  abstract = {As neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments become more sensitive and intrinsic radioactivity in detector materials is reduced, previously minor contributions to the background must be understood and eliminated. With this in mind, cosmogenic backgrounds have been studied with the EXO-200 experiment. Using the EXO-200 TPC, the muon ﬂux (through a ﬂat horizontal surface) underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) has been measured to be Φ = 4.07 ± 0.14 (sys) ± 0.03 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1, with a vertical intensity of Iv = 2.97+−00..1143 (sys) ± 0.02 (stat) × 10−7cm−2 s−1 sr−1. Simulations of muon-induced backgrounds identiﬁed several potential cosmogenic radionuclides, though only 137Xe is a signiﬁcant background for the 136Xe 0νββ search with EXO-200. Muon-induced neutron backgrounds were measured using γ-rays from neutron capture on the detector materials. This provided a measurement of 137Xe yield, and a test of the accuracy of the neutron production and transport simulations. The independently measured rates of 136Xe neutron capture and of 137Xe decay agree within uncertainties. Geant4 and FLUKA simulations were performed to estimate neutron capture rates, and these estimates agreed to within ∼40% or better with measurements. The ability to identify 136Xe(n, γ) events will allow for rejection of 137Xe backgrounds in future 0νββ analyses.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report on the characterization of the Hamamatsu VUV4 Vacuum Ultra-Violet (VUV) sensitive Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) as part of the development of a solution for the detection of liquid xenon scintillation light for the nEXO experiment. Various SiPM features, such as: dark noise, gain, correlated avalanches, direct crosstalk and Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) were measured in a dedicated setup at TRIUMF. SiPMs were characterized in the range $163 \text{ } \text{K} \leq \text{T}\leq 233 \text{ } \text{K}$. We report a PDE of $13.4\pm2.6\%$ for $189\pm 7$ nm light at a SiPM over voltage of $3.6\pm0.2\text{ V}$ and at $\text{T}=233 \text{ }\text{K}$. Within systematic uncertainties, this value meets nEXO requirements. At an over voltage of $3.1\pm0.2$ V and at $\text{T}=163 \text{ }\text{K}$ the number of Correlated Avalanches (CAs) per pulse in the $1 \upmu\text{s}$ interval following the trigger pulse is $0.161\pm0.005$. At the same settings the Dark-Noise (DN) rate is $0.137\pm0.002 \text{ Hz/mm}^{2}$. Both the number of CAs and the DN rate are within nEXO specifications.},

In the analysis window a background level of $1.0_{-0.4}^{+0.6}\cdot10^{-3}$ cts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) has been achieved; if normalized to the energy resolution this is the lowest ever achieved in any 0$\nu\beta\beta$ experiment. No signal is observed and a new 90 \% C.L. lower limit for the half-life of $8.0\cdot10^{25}$ yr is placed when combining with our previous data.

  abstract = {High Purity Germanium Detectors have excellent energy resolution; the best among the technologies used in double beta decay. Since neutrino-less double beta decay hinges on the search for a rare peak upon a background continuum, this strength has enabled the technology to consistently provide leading results. The Ge crystals at the heart of these experiments are very pure; they have no measurable U or Th contamination. The added efforts to reduce the background associated with electronics, cryogenic cooling, and shielding have been very successful, leading to the longevity of productivity. The ﬁrst experiment published in 1967 by the Milan group of Fiorini, established the benchmark half-life limit > 3 × 1020 yr. This bound was improved with the early work of the USC-PNNL, UCSB and Milan groups yielding limits above 1023 yr. The Heidelberg-Moscow and USC-PNNL collaborations pioneered the use of enriched Ge for detector fabrication. Both groups also initiated techniques of analyzing pulse waveforms to reject γ-ray background. These steps extended the limits to just over 1025 yr. In 2000, a subset of the Heidelberg-Moscow collaboration claimed the observation of double beta decay. More recently, the MAJORANA and GERDA collaborations have developed new detector technologies that optimize the pulse waveform analysis. As a result, the GERDA collaboration refuted the claim of observation with a revolutionary approach to shielding by immersing the detectors directly in radio-pure liquid argon. In 2018, the MAJORANA collaboration, using a classic vacuum cryostat and high-Z shielding, achieved a background level near that of GERDA by developing very pure materials for use nearby the detectors. Together, GERDA and MAJORANA have provided limits approaching 1026 yr. In this article, we elaborate on the historical use of Ge detectors for double beta decay addressing the strengths and weaknesses. We also summarize the status and future as many MAJORANA and GERDA collaborators have joined with scientists from other efforts to give birth to the LEGEND collaboration. LEGEND will exploit the best features of both experiments to extend the half-life limit beyond 1028 yr with a ton-scale experiment.},
